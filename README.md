<br>
The gates of shell is a Holberton School project in the first trimester, helping student to understand the advanced concepts behind the shell program include process, system call, bit manipulation, file managment, error handling
<br>
*General*
<br>
Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
Who is Ken Thompson
How does a shell work
What is a pid and a ppid
How to manipulate the environment of the current process
What is the difference between a function and a system call
How to create processes
What are the three prototypes of main
How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
How to execute another program with the execve system call
How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
<br>
*Output*
<br>
Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
<br>
Example of error with sh:

$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
<br>
Same error with your program hsh:

$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$

<br>
*Compilation*
<br>
Your shell will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
<br>
*Testing*
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
<br>
But also in non-interactive mode:

$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
<br>
*Checks*
The Checker will be released at the end of the project (1-2 days before the deadline). We strongly encourage the entire class to work together to create a suite of checks covering both regular tests and edge cases for each task. See task 8. Test suite.
